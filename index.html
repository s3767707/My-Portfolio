                      <h5>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h5>
                      <p>I started my interest in IT as a gamer during primary school. However, the novelty to continue playing games wears off quickly, resulting in me sparking the interest what is going behind the game and how does it work. After high school, I was introduced to trading by a friend and was attracted to it since then. I found my interest in analysing graph and data in order to predict future stock movements which compliments with the data science sector. The only imperfection is that science subjects are the only focus in our high school education leaving IT a brand new field yet to be discovered and learned later on which much more increases the difficulty of me mastering it.

                      <h5>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h5>
                      <p>I decided to study abroad as IT degrees in my country are not that popular and does not value much when applying for jobs. Melbourne city is my choice as my sister is working here and can lend me a hand in coping with new study and living environment. After much research, RMIT and Melbourne University are my top choice as they all achieve high ranks in the QS World University Rankings. RMIT is my final choice as being awarded an overall 5 QS Stars in eight out of eight categories, it has no doubt the top-notch teaching qualities, equipment and facilities. However, the most important factor is it offers a more affordable price in IT degree and located in Melbourne Central which provides easy transport is the icing on the cake.

                      <h5>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h5>
                      <p>The demand for skilled IT industry professionals across Australia and overseas is huge. That also means it is highly competitive. To increase my employment chance, I believe it is crucial to work in all facets of IT including software engineering, computer programming, web design and development, cybersecurity and system analysis. My main expectation for this degree is to deliver knowledge on programming principles, skills and practices for modern software development. I am also convinced that gaining knowledge of the processes and associated tools required to service the software development lifecycle will post a great advantage in my future job positions which highly demand team collaboration.

                     <h5>My Personal thoughts.</h5>
                     <p>Based on the test results above, it clearly shows I am the introverted type of person which I fully agree with but at the same time feeling alarmed as this is not the ideal trait to proceed further in the IT industry which relies heavily on team work. Besides that, I also found me being part of a less intuitive and assertive person unfavoured my conditions where people around me does not know me well enough as I seldom communicate with them. With a slightly higher planning and tactics ability, I believe that pragmatist style is the ideal learning style for me as it implements trials and errors in term of solving problems which requires strong self-conscientiousness and wise decision making.

                      <h5>What do the results of these tests mean for me?</h5>
                      <p>Personality tests are useful because they show individual strengths that enable me to determine where my talents are best served. By having a greater knowledge of my personality, I can discover careers and places that match my personality. This makes it easier for me to determine the types of careers that are suitable for myself through examining the test results. Besides that, align the personality scores with potential career paths ensures that I am heading in the right direction. Reflection on the alignment after every test is also crucial as it provides knowledge of your personality traits can help you determine the types of professional and personal development that you need. For example, someone who scores low on extraversion yet is seen as having management potential would benefit from communication skills training in order to boost their skills in social interaction. After making all the shortcomings, it is necessary to consider you can best demonstrate your strengths through development and experience. For example, if you score very high on openness to experience, then consider how you can be more creative in your job. Speak to your supervisor about assignments that will demonstrate this personality trait.

                      <h5>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h5>
                      <p>By observing and analysing my test results, I believe it allows me to fully understand my shortcomings which may post great problems when working in a team. Being an introverted and less assertive person is definitely not a great practice in order to achieve great teamwork in fulfilling task. I recognize the need to make a change on my own behaviour by trying to sound up more in discussions and be more positive in expressing my thoughts. I plan to participate in more social activities and try to make more friends.

                   <div class="box">
                      <h5>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h5>
                      <p>Rather than putting people into pre-categorized boxes, I have faith that everyone can spark candid conversations and create all-too-important awareness around one very important fact—that not everyone works or thinks the same way. One of the most important conclusions drawn from personality research is that teams with a range of personalities are more likely to find success as variations of personalities had a balancing effect during team projects. For example, team members with more social and agreeable attitudes were able to help mitigate conflict and maintain team optimism, boost morale and encourage involvement during stressful situations when negative feelings are festering. As any project manager knows, complex projects contain many phases between initiation and completion while personality assessments can give project managers insight on how best to empower his team members. For example, one team member might be better at kicking off a project and getting buy-in, while another team member might be stronger when it comes to planning and details. However, our judgement should not rely fully on personality assessments, but by using the data properly, we can create more opportunities to optimize the way we work and build team communication.
